# GroceryList
Hi, I am Rupak, a passionate developer from India. I am currently working on GroceryList webapp (https://grocerylistmaker.azurewebsites.net). I am currently 
learning Flask framework for this project. I hosted this webapp using Azure webapp services. For any interaction you can mail me on rupakganvir12@gmail.com.
All my projects are available on https://github.com/RupakGanvir. You can also connect me through my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupak-ganvir-8a46a7213.

This webapp is helpful to make a list of grocery items just by adding the items in the list. We can even easily remove the items just by selecting the item and clicking 
the remove item button.
